      Hey there! I am Pranabendra Prasad Chandra. 
      <br \>
      <br \>
      I received my B. E. degree in Electrical Engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, in 2020. I was shortlisted for the Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) Fellowship in 2014. During my undergraduate studies, I interned at Goldman Sachs in Bangalore, where I currently work as an Analyst. 
      <br \>
      <br \>
      On self-reflection, I have found that both the academic and the industrial worlds fascinate me, due to their common patterns - problem solving and working on an idea. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate enough to undertake projects and research works under some of my professors, who mentored me and guided me throughout. I am primarily interested in the fields of signal processing and machine learning, along with control systems and embedded systems. 
      <br \>
      <br \>
      Studying Electrical Engineering has made me fall in love with engineering mathematics more, especially differential equations, linear algebra, numerical methods and stochastic processes. Two subjects that are my particular favourites - Digital Signal Processing and Non-Linear Control Systems.
